# Setting up The Smart Server.

This repo contains the main Rails server for the Smart budgeting application. This was created as the final project for the Multiverse Software Engineering Bootcamp.

Please follow the below instructions to get set up.

# Requirements

Please ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Ruby 3.1.3
- Rails 7.0.4

# After cloning

Ensure that you cd into the directory named "smart_budget" and run "bundle". This will install the necessary packages contained in the gem file.

Following this, run "rails s" to start the server.

Happy developing!
